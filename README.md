# Project-Crash-Injury-Prediction
This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of a crash dataset, focusing on understanding factors contributing to crash incidents. The dataset includes various attributes such as location details, road conditions, weather influences, and the types of vehicles involved in accidents. By examining these factors, the analysis aims to uncover trends, correlations, and potential risk factors that contribute to crashes. The study leverages data preprocessing techniques to clean and structure the data for meaningful insights. Advanced data visualization methods are used to illustrate key patterns, helping researchers, policymakers, and traffic analysts make data-driven decisions to improve road safety.
